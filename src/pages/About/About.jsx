                With three years of experience in UX/UI, Iâ€™ve led user research,
                built brand identities from the ground up, and communicated
                data-driven designs to non-technical stakeholders.

                Compelled by a genuine curiosity and desire for growth, I
                obtained a diploma in software development. Now, I bridge design
                and engineering to create intuitive, accessible, and scalable
                solutions.
